## Sweepit implementation of miinesweeper using react/redux

Simplified version had been implemented in AngularJS at
http://plnkr.co/edit/HqcNSxuw6JLqPPi50lmJ

Using redux seems to be an overkill for this little app, but provides
some learning ground to redux ideas such as combined reducers, component containers,
async dispatch.
The routing is also not really needed. Kept it to preserve generated app structure.
Added a couple of simple tests to helper file.
TODO: fix test runner.
